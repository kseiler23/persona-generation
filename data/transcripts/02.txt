Respondent:
Ladies and gentlemen, let me take you back in time to 2009. This show came
out. The TV of 2009 was truly a beautiful thing. We've watched much of it on
this channel and today's show is no exception. It was called True Beauty.
Basically, a bunch of contestants who all think that they are hot enough to be
included in a major magazine's most beautiful people issue compete for a cash
prize of $100,000. I mean, that's taking inflation into account, that's worth a lot
in today's money.
Okay, so here's the catch, right? The contestants are judged on their outer
appearance. Obviously, it's brutal, right? This happened in 2009. So, you know,
there's just no filter in terms of commenting on another person's physical
appearance, right? But the twist is they're actually getting judged on their inner
beauty.
Yes, they have cameras following these people around and when they think
they're not being judged, that's when they really are. Honestly, kind of seems
like a good idea for a show to be honest. As I'm saying this, I'm like, damn, I'd
watch that. And we are about to.
So, are these contestants beautiful inside and out or are they just a pretty face?
Let's find out.
Show Narrator:
As well as have their photo featured in a major magazine's most beautiful
people issue.
Respondent:
Okay. Yeah. So, they get the cash prize. Plus, they actually get their photo in the
most beautiful people issue, which would be an insane flex. I would submit
myself for this show just for the off chance that maybe that would happen. I
mean, it wouldn't in a million years, but like could you imagine that? Just
walking around being like, "I'm literally one of the most beautiful people on the
planet. One of the top hundred. You can't say anything to me. I know we don't
have a reservation, but you must understand. I'm one of the most beautiful
people on the planet. You must seat me."
Show Narrator:
In the end, only one will have what it takes to emerge as America's true beauty.

Show Host:
Hi guys, welcome.
Respondent:
I recognize that guy. Where is that guy from? Oh man, he was in like some other
show. Or maybe I watched this show in 2009. This guy was a judge in something
else. I know that for a fact.
Show Host:
So, as we speak, our 10 beautiful people are pulling up to the front of this
house. It's a private pool party in the Hollywood Hills. I think the perfect
atmosphere for our 10 contestants to meet each other.
Respondent:
I got to say, you know, as superficial as that was, right? It's got to feel insanely
sick pulling up to a house party where there's a red velvet secured line of people
waiting to get in and you pull up in a yellow Lambo. Again, very superficial, very
Los Angeles, very Miami, but I mean, you can't deny that would feel good getting
out of that thing. Even if the paparazzi are fake, just hired by the production,
whatever. Just to play the part. You just walk right by the line. Yeah, you know
me. I mean, I'm literally one of the most beautiful people on the planet. So, let
my hot self in here. I don't know why I'm yelling so much today. Sorry.
Contestant 1:
If I want to be the center of attention, I'll make myself the center of attention.
Contestant 2:
I live in Idaho, and I actually own and operate my own vitamin store. I'm also
a dancer. My responsibility is to basically please the ladies. When the curtain
opens, you actually start to believe for a second that you are a rock star.
Respondent:
How's it going? Why is this kind of like another dating show just with a studio
audience? Is it not? Man, this is honestly like a dating show if they just filled the
house with random people who are just watching these other people be hot and
make out.
Contestant 3:

I like to think I'm naturally beautiful. I think if you have it, use it to your
advantage because otherwise it's just a waste. I think that my look is kind of
androgynous.
Respondent:
As I was going to say that. Androgynous. Soon as she showed up, I was like,
she's looking very androgynous. Androgynous. I don't know what androgynous
means, by the way. Don't know what that means.
Contestants (meeting each other):
I notice your teeth are like perfect.
Yep. Thank you.
Hi. How's it going? Hi. How are you? Hi. Great. What's your name?
Nice to meet you. Hi. Nice to meet you. Me, too.
What do you do? I just graduated with a degree in biology.
Scientist. Well, not really. Well, I club dance now. Okay.
Respondent:
Androgynously, though.
Contestant 4:
What's up? Probably I work out on a regular basis. Every day when I work
out, I train extremely hard to look good naked. That's my bottom line goal.
When I put my birthday suit on, I want everybody to be impressed.
Respondent:
Thanks, guys. Thank you. These people are just like born to be famous, you
know? They would all be some form of TikTok influencer nowadays for sure.
Some people just have it. You know what I mean? Just getting out of a car in
front of a group of people who have no idea who you are and just being like,
"Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you so much for the love. Appreciate y'all.
Thank you so much." It's like that's just what famous people do.
Contestants:
I mean, it's to show off your muscles.

It looks really good on you. It looks great. I don't know what these are called,
but biceps, right?
Respondent:
Do you think the producers were like, "All right, when you sit down, make sure
you just compliment each other a lot." Like, don't hit on each other. Just
compliment each other a lot about physical stuff. Your muscles are really big.
Nice teeth.
Contestant 5:
I live in Texas, born and raised. I started pageants whenever I was 14. In 2002,
I won the title of Miss Teen Texas, and I'm currently a local pageant winner,
and I just competed in the state pageant. One thing that I cannot live without
are my eyelash extensions.
Respondent:
Same girl. Same.
Contestant 6:
I am a proud, sexy black man because I understand there's only one person
walking the earth with my DNA. When I walk into a room, heads turn.
Sometimes I kind of feel like time freezes. I would kind of compare it to a
famous basketball player walking into a basketball arena. I accept it and I
hone it.
Respondent:
It's kind of funny to describe yourself as a proud sexy person. Us sexy people,
you know, we don't get a ton of recognition, but I'm proud to be sexy. Honestly,
I am. We get a bad rep, but it's like, you know, I am who I am, you know, and
you got to take it for what it's worth. So, all I can do is kind of like just go out
there and be confident. Like, I'm hot and people want me and that's fine. And
I'm proud to say that.
Contestant 7:
I am a model. Girls have always been jealous of me because I have the eyes, I
have the hair, I have the body. Look at me.
Respondent:

All right. I guarantee that she's not one of the beautiful on the inside people. No
offense to her, but like you start your thing with people are jealous of me. Yeah.
I mean, not looking good for you personality-wise. You know?
Contestant 7 (continued):
I know that I'm beautiful because every time that I walk into a room, people
stare at me like I'm some kind of freak, but now I realize that it was beauty.
Respondent:
I used to think people, you know, would look at me and would see just this
horrific monster, you know, five arms, tentacles, antenna. I just found out
recently it's because I'm hot and people want me. So, hey there.
Contestants (meeting):
How are you? Nice to meet you. Your eyes are gorgeous. Thank you. Thank
you. Love your teeth. Thank you. Love your necklace. Thank you. Your muscles
are awesome. Awesome muscles. Those are really cool muscles.
Respondent:
Play that welcome game. Okay. You want to start? Good. Really good. Yeah.
Thank you for that drum roll. Thank you. You didn't like my drum roll? I did.
Okay. That's why I was saying good. That was the most sarcastic "thank you for
that drum roll." I said I like your drum roll. Go ahead. Give it to me. Say thank
you. It was a good drum roll. All right. It was like totally like timely and like very
appropriate and funny in the moment. So, I mean, I don't know what you're
being difficult about. Like, it was actually low-key good. Like, I agree. There are
times when you shouldn't do a drum roll, but like that was not one of those
times. He should have just done it again right there. Right in the face. How's
that drum roll?
Contestant 8:
It's very possible that I could be the most beautiful person in the country. When
I look in the mirror, I see gorgeous skin, gorgeous eyes, nose is perfect, lips are
perfect, eyebrows are perfect. Everything about me is perfect.
Respondent:
God damn, I want that confidence. I would love that. Just look in the mirror and
just be stoked every time you look in the mirror. That would be awesome.

Contestant 8 (continued):
I'm so thankful to be beautiful.
Contestant 9:
I live in New York, and I love high-end women's wear clothing. I just feel very
sexy. Knowing it's a little more expensive and knowing it's the best of the best
and it's couture and you know it just makes you feel really good. Back home I
have over $100,000 worth of just dresses alone and I brought $30,000 worth
of dresses here.
Respondent:
Flex, flex, flex. Insane flex. Actually, this one's about $1,500. Again, in today's
money, I mean, that's at least a million.
Contestant 10:
I can be cocky. I could be the most arrogant person that you've ever seen. Girls
love that. If you're cocky, there's nothing better than cocky because then it
draws them like flies. What's better than a cocky person who can back it up.
Respondent:
Are we finally all here? A toast. All right, y'all. That's our 10 contestants. That
was fun. We have a great group and we know that they are beautiful people
without a doubt. The fun part of this is are they just as beautiful on the inside?
That's the key. We shall see.
Show Judge:
You guys ready to shake things up a bit? All right. So, let's send in our waiter
to see how they all react to their very first test. Okay, here he is.
Respondent:
So, let's call in our chainsaw murderer right now. We're going to cut these guys
open and see what the inside of these people look like, shall we? To see how they
all react to their very first test.
They laugh so hard at that. Yes. Yes. Spill the drinks on them. They will not be
having those. Yes. Spill on these sexy people.
Contestants:

Are you okay?
I don't know what the hell happened, but he slipped and he knocked the
chocolate all over everyone. Our couches are ruined.
Respondent:
The waiter was hating. Okay. You know there's a lot of hate going on when
you're beautiful. The waiter was hating. Yeah, that's what it was. That's what it
was. He intentionally did that. I mean, I guess he did technically, but it wasn't
because he was hired by the show to do it. It's because he hated the fact that you
were hot. He wanted to take some revenge.
Contestant:
Oh, hell no. My lucky gold shoes did get a little chocolate on them. That ain't
cool. That was like my number one concern. I had them dunked in the
champagne holders. I'm pissed off right now.
Other Contestants:
Oh, it's a bromance. That could have been hot. That's a very nice chest. That
was very sweet.
Respondent:
Oh, it's a bromance. I thought she said, "Oh, it's a brown man." I was like, "What
is that?" Just some random racism right there. I wouldn't put it past 2009.
Truly.
That's kind of hot though. One contestant so far has helped a couple people. So
that contestant is actually a pretty good guy. He's helping people. I bet that the
girl with the $1,500 dress is probably pretty pissed. Is she not? This is couture.
Show Host:
I am your host for the show and I am also one of your judges along with my
friend celebrity fashion editor and beauty expert and truly America's first
supermodel.
Respondent:
Drop dead gorgeous.
Show Host:

The winner of this competition will receive $100,000 cash. And be featured in
a major magazine's 100 most beautiful people issue.
Respondent:
Man, it's so funny. It's so funny that their picture would just be in there amongst
99 other celebrities. Like actual celebrities. It's just like 50 actual celebrities and
then just some random person. Like number 51, random contestant. Number
52, a famous actor. Hey, go back. Who was that person? Who is that? I don't
know. He was hot though. I mean, yeah, he is.
Show Host:
Since you've had a rough day, what do you say you guys go back, rest up, and
get some beauty sleep? Well, I mean, since you're here, what do you think
about this house? You like it? It's yours.
Contestants:
Look at this place. Oh my god. Check this out. Oh my god, dude. You got to
check this view. I'm not in Idaho anymore. You know what I'm saying? I love
it. I love it. Cool table. Check this out. Oh my goodness. That is awesome.
There's a table. Yo, there's a kitchen table. We got a table.
All of a sudden, we go into the rooms and our pictures are on the walls. I really
like that because, well, kind of conceited and I admit it.
Respondent:
And I admit it. Truly, how do they cast for this? Like just, hey, if you're super
vain, please, we want you.
Contestants:
Oh my god. Oh my god, dude. Are you kidding me? Wow, man. Is that me?
You look so good. Yeah, that's me.
Respondent:
I love how they're all like, "That is so fire." Holy crap. Oh my god. I love this.
Like, anyone else walks in this room, sees a painting of themselves, they'd be
like, "Oh, what? Why? Sorry. Sorry that the painter had to look at a picture of
me for that long to do that. Take it down. Take it down. I don't like seeing that.
Take it down." These people are all like, "Oh, that is sick." You know, I wasn't a
fan of art before, but now definitely changed my mind.

Contestants:
This is unreal. Yeah, this is going to be interesting. Yes, sir. It's going to be
interesting. Definitely. So fire to be sleeping under this every night. So fire.
All of the guys in the house come across as just caring about their looks and
just caring about their muscles. Feel that Cali sun on your back, baby. Rev it.
Feel it. But one contestant seems as though he actually has a brain. I like to
write.
Respondent:
Everyone knows it's easiest to write when you have your sunglasses on inside.
Everyone knows that. Everyone knows when you can barely see the page. That's
when it really flows. That's when the pen just glides.
Contestant:
Another contestant walks over and asked me what I was doing. And then I
read a little bit of what I was writing. The fat kid in me has made me swear
that I always share his story.
Respondent:
Beautiful. Just beautiful. Just beautiful. Beautiful stuff. The fat kid in me is
reaching for the donut. And I'm telling him, "No, it's not worth it." Little fatty.
Contestant:
I'd be strong for anyone I met that wrestled with rejection. When I was
younger, I used to be heavy set. You know, I was writing in my journal just
like in my heart of hearts. I'm really like a fat kid at heart. He knows what it's
like to cry at night because some say you're too fat, too short, or too ugly. I
was very touched because the things that he writes are just so passionate.
Respondent:
Passionate. I love the way this girl talks. Writes super passionate.
Female Contestant:
I can tell that he's had those past experiences as I have. He's ruling from my
heart. He's calling all the shots. He's the boss. I'm the slave. That's kind of how
I see like how I look is like kind of like a suit, but really like the real me is like,
you know, like that fat kid that was mistreated.

Respondent:
She's crying. Damn. Okay. Okay. I mean, hey, he's moving her. He's doing
something.
Female Contestant:
And then she started to tell me how, you know, when she was younger, she
was heavy. People in my high school would make fun of me because I went
from very very skinny to becoming overweight because that's the way that my
body reacted to puberty. And I know how it is to be that girl in the high school
that people are calling fat that people are saying lose weight. You know, we
connected in the same experiences that we've had in the past. And I think that's
what puts passion in people's hearts and it just touched me that there's
somebody else like me in the house.
Respondent:
Okay. Okay. So, we got a little bit of, you know, perhaps some bullying trauma.
Add a little dimension to these people. Add some layers. Okay.
Show Narrator:
And how do the beauties behave when they think no one is watching?
Respondent:
No. That's so not right. The beauties. God, that's awesome. I want to be referred
to as the beauties. People just call me that. Sucks.
Contestants (doing dishes):
Should I wash this right now? Yes. I think you should. This is a once in a
lifetime thing here. Oh, is it? You've ever done dishes before? I put my hair
back. Is this considered washing it? Like am I done or I have to do more?
Well, I would say the sponge probably helps.
Respondent:
Pretty insane to reveal that you can't wash a dish on national television. You got
to think you just leave it in the sink. You know, even if you can't do it, you know,
just leave it there. You don't want to be admitting that you don't know how to
do one dish. I don't know how to clean a dish. You don't know how to clean a
dish. It's like I mean, it's pretty self-explanatory. Like you know how to clean
other stuff, right? Or do you not? Have you never showered before?

Female Contestant (bathroom incident):
Sorry. You can come right back in. Just like the bathroom, why don't you
please go out? Nothing. I couldn't get ready this morning. Another contestant
just goes in the bathroom like helps herself. She's like, "Do you mind if I go in
the shower first?" She's like, "Oh my god, I'm so perfect." She's like, "Oh my
god, I have to take a huge stinky... Can you get out of the bathroom? I have
to..." What a bad person. She's so fake.
Respondent:
Fake. You said it.
Show Narrator:
In this competition, pageant faces isn't going to cut it. Nobody's that nice.
Nobody has to go that much. It's so fake. Nobody has diarrhea like she does.
Show Host:
Good morning. Hey, good morning. How are you guys? Good. Still hot. I
washed a dish today. Over the next eight weeks, we will be putting you through
a series of challenges and judging you on your beauty. But today, we're going
to leave it up to science.
Respondent:
Science? I've never heard of that. What even is that?
Show Host:
Believe it or not, there is a scientific equation that measures physical beauty.
All of you are going to go down to Beverly Hills and you're going to meet with
a doctor who specializes in this. He's going to give you a beauty analysis. He's
measuring all of your physical features, your face, your body, everything. He's
going to take all of your individual numbers, put them into his equation, and
come up with your beauty score.
Respondent:
This has got to be fake, right? That's got to be fake. Like, it sounds believable,
but then you're like, "Wait, why would that exist? Who is paying for that
service?" That's basically like you walk in and you're like, "Hey, can I pay for
you to just kind of mess up my confidence?" What would you need that score
for? It's not like your credit score. You don't have to like use that to apply to

anything. Maybe there's some like secret way to like get into an exclusive club
or something. You just slip on that sheet of paper. You're like, "Yeah, I'm a 10.
Scientifically proven, so you're going to have to let me in."
Contestant:
I looked over at another contestant and she was all smiley and I was thinking,
"Okay, honey. You look like a normal person, another face in the crowd. You
don't look like a celebrity. This is a celebrity face, not you."
Respondent:
A celebrity.
Show Host:
The winner of this challenge is free from elimination. The bottom two
contestants are going to meet me and the judges in the Hall of Beauty where
one of you will be going home. Good luck. Your beauty bus awaits.
Respondent:
Oh, this is a great place to pause it. I'm going to save this for a potential
thumbnail. Why do they always do this in reality shows from this era? The
reactions are always just way too much. Like, do you think they went around
the room and they were like, "All right, just pretend like you just heard the
craziest thing you've ever heard in your life. More. More. More." Yes. More.
Show Narrator:
Our contestants think they're on their way to Beverly Hills for a simple beauty
analysis. Little do they know, they're also stepping into their next hidden
camera challenge.
Contestant:
What do you do? I'm a fine artist. I paint people.
Respondent:
Oh, wait. Okay. So, maybe that service, if it is real, if this is a real thing, which I
don't know, probably is not, but like if it is, it's probably done by plastic
surgeons to be like, "Look at how messed up you are. We can fix all this." I see.
Contestant:

Could you draw me? Really? What did you say? You drew me.
Respondent:
Oh, she said it with a southern accent. Can you draw me? It's words that come
into your ears. It's how that works. You always make sense. You're always
making sense.
Contestants (arguing):
Oh, you're getting... You really are getting mad. I just don't like you. I mean,
I'll put it on record. Why? I don't know. Because you annoy me from day one.
I don't like this contestant. I don't like anything about her. This contestant is
the definition of ignorance. So, like from here on out, wherever I am, don't be
there. That's cool. Yeah. Well, that's cool. Well, we're on a show together,
though, so it's like we kind of contractually like have to be in the same room
for most of this. So.
Respondent:
Honestly, props to this contestant. Props. Just looking her in the face just be
like, I just don't like you. Straight up. That's what reality TV is about right there,
though.
Doctor:
Everyone, my name is Dr. Palmer. I'm here today to evaluate your beauty. I'm
a real board certified plastic surgeon and beauty expert. My beauty code can
assign every person on this planet a number between 1 and 100. I'm going to
take your face and your body and compare it against a set of ideal shapes,
proportions, and angles. And the only question that remains to be answered
today is what's your number? This is my assistant, Debbie.
Respondent:
Debbie just got her ears done clearly.
Show Narrator:
His assistant, nurse Debbie, is a plant. She will attempt to get a rise out of our
beautiful people. Let's see.
Doctor:
I could take you with me first.

Respondent:
What if... Oh, man. What if she had like a glass of chocolate? Liquid chocolate.
Nurse (spilling):
I can take you... Oh! Again. Sorry.
Respondent:
Why does this keep happening? Why do you even have chocolate? Aren't you
like a nurse assistant? What is happening right now?
Nurse:
Sorry. I like to eat that on my lunch break. Sorry.
Show Narrator:
First, our beauties will be taken into the examination room and examined.
Nurse:
Got a little granny butt there.
Respondent:
Damn. Roasted. You got a little granny butt there and it's covered in chocolate.
What's going on?
Doctor:
That's hard to complain about. I'm measuring the width of your face into equal
segments. Each one should be about the width of one eye. This side's slightly
flatter than this one. So, I'm minus five for that.
Show Narrator:
Then each of our beauties will be left alone in the room with a hidden camera
and everyone's medical files out for display. When they think they're alone,
will they look in each other's files?
Respondent:
Yay. She didn't look in the files, so she passes. I mean, you got to look in the
files. They're right there. You got to look in them. They're not like official
medical files. It's like beauty score. What? It's not official medical analysis.

Nurse:
Got some funky feet there. I'm about to take a look at your feet, Miss Debbie. I
have got the cutest feet in the whole world. Well, prove it.
Contestant:
Do you really believe that this is how you can measure someone's beauty?
Doctor:
I'm not only telling you do I believe it. I mean, I don't believe it, but I just... But
I do it. People pay me for it.
Contestant:
People pay people for crack.
Doctor:
Well, that's because crack gives you a great high. That one's minus five.
Nurse (later):
Now, nurse Debbie, let me tell you about nurse Debbie going to say to me, "You
got some funky feet." That's what she said to me. You got funky feet. Let me see
your feet, coach. Freckles. It's a beautiful neck. They call this a nice swan neck.
That's fabulous. That's minus three.
Respondent:
Don't...
Nurse:
What are you doing? Snooping the other people's dimensions. How dare you?
Don't.
Respondent:
I can't wait till one of these people just absolutely snaps at Debbie. Just shut up,
you little gremlin.
Nurse:
Where do you put all that? Those hips will be great when you have kids. Minus
10. Okay, so for this section it's minus three.

Respondent:
That one surprises me. I thought for sure she'd be just facing those files, just
sniffing them around, you know? That's my boy.
Nurse:
From your chin down to your nose. And that is uneven. This one is a little bit
smaller than this.
Respondent:
Wow, you are messed up. My god, you are a freak. I've never seen someone with
these proportions before. I mean, are you even human?
Contestant (looking at files):
Oh, no. She's opening it. That one. That's her picture. It's her file. That's not
hers.
Respondent:
She's reading them all.
Nurse (to male contestant):
I'd measure your guns, but then you'd just be showing off. Honestly, I've never
measured them and nor would I. Man, your stomach is rock hard. You're like
a little older than everybody else. Great physique. I don't care if you're the
oldest or not. Good for you.
Respondent:
Listen, bro to bro. You are jacked, my guy. Congrats on being jacked, bro. This
is not Dr. Steve talking at all. Okay, this is friend Steve. You are looking good,
my guy. Good for him. Good, good, good.
Nurse:
And those are perfectly symmetric, so that's very nice. Yeah, it's real. And she's
the first one who looks good in this outfit. Oh, and you know why? It looks like
I'm nude. That's why. Yeah, it's like a birthday suit. Okay, so those width
segments are not equal. This one's a little bit higher than this one. Pretty good
overall. I'd say minus two. Zero deductions for that. Could be slightly thinner,
but you know, not enough for a deduction. Nice hair. Thank you. It's a lot of
hair.

Respondent:
Why does Debbie roast some people and for other people she's complimenting
them? I feel like she actually has crushes on some of these guys. She destroyed
the girls. And then for the guys, it's like, wow, rock hard stomach, beautiful hair.
Oh, no. He just went right for the file. Okay, so three contestants all looked at
the file. They failed.
Show Judge:
So, now that we know their inner beauty, I don't know about you guys, but I'm
anxious to know what the doctor says about their outer beauty. Let's see what
really matters here.
Respondent:
Okay. I mean, whoever looked at the file is not automatically out of the
competition. I'm on pins and needles to find out what their actual beauty score
was aesthetically because that for me is going to be a clincher. I'm on pins and
needles to find out about that. Is that right? Can you use that that way?
Show Host:
Today, you met with a medical expert who evaluated your physical
appearance and gave you a score from 1 to 100. The person with the highest
score will be the winner and will continue in this game. The two bottom
scoring contestants will meet with me and the judges in the Hall of Beauty
where you will get executed for being so disgustingly ugly.
Respondent:
I know I'm not going home. I'm not going home.
Show Host:
Keep in mind, the doctor said any score over 85 is good-looking. Any score
over 95 is star quality. Please step forward. The doctor said you have a little
bit of a thin lip, but you do have incredible cheekbones and a spectacular eye
color.
Respondent:
The doctor said you have a spectacular eye color. What kind of thing is that to
measure?

Show Host:
Your beauty score is 92. You are safe. Your beauty score is 91. Congratulations.
Contestant:
That's really nice to hear and everything. It's something I already knew, but
it's nice to hear it from experts.
Respondent:
Now I can go finally be a star. Thank you. Finally, I have quantitative proof that
I am star quality. Please, Hollywood, chew me up and spit me out.
Show Host:
Your final beauty score is 94. You keep shaking your head. What's going on
with that?
Contestant:
I don't see how anyone could critique someone on being attractive and being
beautiful. That's like irritating to me. So, what do you believe? Do you think
that beauty can be measured?
Same Contestant:
I think it... Yeah, it's like measured in writing, for example, my writing that I
do every day. Should read some of that. That's beautiful. Hell do you measure
beauty? Like I don't understand what the doctor critiques his opinion. I don't
even really want to hear it because it doesn't matter to me. Everything about
that business disgust me.
Judge:
You know, I don't mind someone asking questions, but this is scientific. He's
an expert. So, just take that, put it in your hip pocket, and walk away with it.
Contestant:
Gotcha.
Show Host:
Well, your final beauty score, for what it's worth, is 94.
Respondent:

He's like, "Okay, now actually I believe it." Cool. Yeah. No, I'm actually down
for the score now. All of a sudden, I'm down for science. That doesn't change
anything.
Show Host:
Please step forward. Can someone get a low score, please? The doctor said that
you have thin lips, but an amazing body, especially for someone who's 31 years
old. The doctor coined you to be close to as perfect as a famous actor.
Contestant:
Thank you.
Respondent:
Wow. Like seriously, are you kidding me? Like a famous actor? There's no way.
That's my guy. Let's go. 110, bro.
Show Host:
Your final beauty score is 95. You guys are the winners of this challenge.
Congratulations.
Winner:
Wow. I have to thank God, my mom, and my dad.
Respondent:
I mean, sickest speech ever. Just one guitar riff. I want to thank God, my mom,
and my dad. Done. Oh yeah, I'm hot. Cool. I want to thank God, my mom, and
my dad for giving me those jeans.
Show Host:
Your beauty score is 94. You are safe. According to the doctor, he said that
three of you have a lack of symmetry in your faces.
Contestant:

I don't care if I have a symmetrical face. I don't care if I have a non-
symmetrical face. I am not ugly.

Show Host:
With a final beauty score of 91, you are safe. Congratulations.

Contestant:
Wait, excuse me.
Respondent:
Yeah, get wrecked, freak.
Show Host:
You two had the lowest scores in the group and will face elimination in the hall
of beauty.
Contestant:
This is stupid anyway.
Respondent:
Swear a lot of these faces are like straight from a Tim and Eric sketch. Just like
what was this? This is stupid anyway. That right there.
Contestant:
I'm mad. Like for real. I'm serious. Yeah. Stupid. I'm just upset right now
because I really feel that I should not be in this situation because I know how
beautiful I am. I'm not ugly. I don't give a... That doesn't make any sense.
Seriously, I'm not like sad because I think I'm ugly or none of that. I'm just
pissed off because this is stupid.
Other Contestant:
You have too much going on and you know you're too talented. You have way
more than your looks.
First Contestant:
We only have to convince her that she knows that. No, I know. I know. But
those scores are scientifically proven. So I'm just saying like you know you can
still have confidence and whatever but like you know I got a 94 so like it's you
know seems right.
Respondent:
I cannot believe that she turned her back on the judges. That is so rude.
Judge:

Is it? You never turn your back on judges. We are royalty. I think one
contestant is maybe more aesthetically a beautiful girl, but she really did rifle
through all of those files. And the other contestant didn't look through the files.
Both of these girls have their pluses and minuses.
Another Judge:
We cannot have file riflers. Nobody that's going to go and rifle through
people's files. We cannot have those people. They are bad people.
Contestant 1:
I might be a little cocky, but I happen to think that I'm drop dead gorgeous. I
don't give a... what anybody else says. And that's all. I don't think that I should
have been in the bottom two because all those people look the same and I'm
one that looks different. I obviously have something unique that they don't.
And that just adds to my beauty. I think it's probably your personality that
shines to be honest.
Contestant 2:
Y'all know why I'm smiling. Bye-bye. I don't even know how she squeezed
through the door in the first place. Send this girl back to Tennessee or wherever
she came from. No, we got to go. If it's not today, it's going to be next week or
whenever.
Respondent:
What did that mean? Squeeze through the door. Was that a fat joke? Because
that's a little messed up. Come on, buddy. You're a good guy. What's going on?
Show Narrator:
Off to the hall of beauty. Beauty. Beauty. Beauty. As we speak, these two
contestants are on their way to the Hall of Beauty.
Respondent:
What the hell is the Hall of Beauty? What? That's so dumb. That is just some
dumbass 2009 reality TV made-up thing. I think they just thought Americans
were just dumb as hell. Truly. Which I guess I mean people ate this up. So maybe
I don't know. I guess they were just to be sitting here watching this like, "Oh,
beauty scores. Hall of Beauty. Wow."
Show Narrator:

What they don't know is that we have a hidden camera set up in a van across
the street and a production assistant with a whole bunch of coffees. And the
whole object is to see if they will either help him with a coffee, hold the door
open for him, or even acknowledge him. We'll start with the first contestant.
Oh, she looks so pretty. She does look gorgeous.
Respondent:
Did we get it? Yes. She passed. All right. And she was polite enough to let him
go first. She'd wait and everything. Who the hell would just wait there behind
as this guy just struggles just tapping your foot. Go on, get in there, coffee boy.
Show Host:
Welcome to the Hall of Beauty.
Contestant:
Thank you.
Respondent:
I've always wanted to come here to the Hall of Beauty. This is the most beautiful
hall I've ever been to. It connects one room to another better than any hall I've
ever seen.
Show Host:
The judges and I would like to hear from you why you think you each should
stay. We'll start with you.
Contestant 1:
I just don't think it's fair. Honestly, I don't agree with what the doctor said.
What do you think is beauty? Real beauty is natural beauty. Take the makeup
off. And that's what I believe.
Show Host:
Why do you think you should stay in this competition?
Contestant 2:
I mean, I don't necessarily agree that you can measure beauty. I think that
when you're unique, you stand out more. I think that is what beauty is.

Respondent:
I love that neither of them even consider that it's anything other than physical
attractiveness. It's just no makeup. That's what it is. No, it's unique features. It's
the X Factor. What about aura? Ever heard of that concept?
Judge 1:
There does seem to be a cloud that hovers around you and I love your smile
and it's something that I'd like to see more of.
Judge 2:
I think you are a very pretty girl, but as a stylist, I think we need a make under.
I think if we took away some of the eye makeup, maybe cleaned up the hair,
your true beauty will come through.
Show Host:
Okay. You're so beautiful, both of you. But unfortunately, one of you has to go
home.
Respondent:
Drum roll, please. Right. Drum roll. Popped in. Is now a good time for a drum
roll?
Show Host:
You are safe and you can go back to the house and continue the competition.
Winner:
Thank you. Thank you.
Show Host:
You will be going home tonight.
Eliminated Contestant:
Why?
Show Host:
Because we voted you out. We're the judges. Remember that? There's more to
this competition than meets the eye. Not only are you the least attractive

person on the show, but your personality also sucks the most. So that's why
you're going home. We are judging you on your outer beauty. But we're also
judging you on your inner beauty. Okay. Do you think you were truly a
beautiful person? Yeah. See for yourself.
Respondent:
Were you a file rifler?
Contestant (watching footage):
This is stupid. Anyway, I'm just pissed off because this is stupid. Oh, that was
nothing. That was not even private information. That was my folder that I left
up. Okay, we'll see you in a minute. Okay, I was wrong for looking at that, but
honestly, I didn't mean any harm.
Judge:
But honesty to me is what? Did you just interrupt a judge? The guy with the
coffee. That was set up by us to see if you would at least just give a gesture to
help somebody. See for yourself.
Contestant (watching herself ignore the coffee guy):
I think it should be open.
Respondent:
So, even if that's not real, that's hilarious. Just good luck. Oh, man. It must be
tough holding all those coffees. Bye.
Judge:
Beauty is something that is both inside and out. But true beauty comes from
within.
Eliminated Contestant:
Peace out. I'm out of here. True beauty is from within.
Respondent:
I would have pieced out, too. Honestly, it's like, why are you saying it like that?
Eliminated Contestant:

That doesn't mean that you're beautiful on the inside either. You know what?
Peace. Peace out. I'm a good person. I have a big heart. And oh, we've seen
your true color. No, you did not see anything. And I'm ready to go. I'm ready
to go home.
Respondent:
Yikes. Yikes. Well, you know what? I honestly couldn't end the video better than
that. So, hope you enjoyed this. Like if you are... well if you look in the mirror
and hate it, press like. And you
