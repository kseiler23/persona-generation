    "text": "The best way for people to learn what makes other people tick is for them to self-assess and realize what makes them tick, and then listen for the same things which make other people tick. We teach them how to figure people out using seven layers, which are facts, emotions, values, beliefs, motivators, currency and worth. So if you have those seven categories, they can basically, like a jigsaw, piece together things which formulate the person sitting in front of you, which you've probably heard a hundred times but didn't appreciate the significance of."
