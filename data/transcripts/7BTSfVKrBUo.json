I've been in many business situations where trust has broken down and for me the main ingredients of trust are feelings of certainty and repeat experience. They're the two main ingredients so we try and rebuild that. Of course when we hit a bump in the road we have to recognize that something has caused that and it's not beyond us to just apologize for something that we've done wrong. Having a bit of humility that you can recognize mistakes that you've made often allows the other side to do likewise. When you're the first one to say listen I'm probably sorry I got something wrong you normally find that they reciprocate by saying yeah maybe we got something wrong there as well. But the best example I have and it's an example that was given to me by others was that we refer to the past damage as broken china. The concept from Chinese proverbs is that a vase when it's repaired is more valuable than in its original format because we take more care of that slightly fractured piece of china. So for me relationships can become stronger when there's some damage being done because we all recognize the area that caused a problem and we can take care of that in the future."
