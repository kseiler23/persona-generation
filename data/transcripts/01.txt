Respondent:
My fundamental passion is to look around the world for the most hated people
in the world and get between them and the people doing the hatred. And the
reason for that is because you always know you're right.
I'm going to start with one of my great great great grandparents. His name was
[redacted]. He was called [redacted] because he was a smuggler who operated
out of a cove in Cornwall. He was sentenced to death when he was caught by the
customs officials. And back in the day, you could do what was called pleading
the benefit of clergy, which meant simply that you had to read a verse of the
Bible. And so my ancestor recited his verse of the Bible, got pardoned and came
back to Britain and spent the rest of his life in Cornwall spending what money
he had made. And I'm very proud of him. And I like to think that being
sentenced to death in my family was probably a precursor to my whole life.
My dad was a very handsome, very gregarious person. When he was very young,
he was 17, he got his mother to lie about his age so he could sign up for the RAF,
the Air Force, and it was in the middle of World War II. If you were 17 when you
were bombing Germany, what impact psychologically does that have on you?
They label him bipolar, and I don't like those labels, but if you think of manic
depression, my dad was manic most of the time. It's very hard to think of my
father without using the word psychotic. He was quite a philanderer and he was
quite abusive, incredibly emotionally abusive to women and it was just part of
this incredible chauvinism that he had.
I didn't really understand it when I was very young, but as I got into my teens,
I had an agreement with my sister, that if I started behaving like dad, she could
section me, which is what we call putting people in a mental hospital because it
was a real worry and dad was a real danger to himself and others just in terms
of what he did. My father was very very brilliant and my mother was just as
smart as him but she was born a woman in 1926.
My mother in 1944 really wanted to be part of the war effort. She had just done
really well in her French written exam and she thought that qualified her to be
parachuted into France and join the resistance. So she went down to London on
the train from Northampton and she went to the foreign office and this young
chap sat her down for a cup of tea and she said, "I'm ready to be dropped into
France to join the resistance." And this young man said, "Well, you're not 18
yet." This was the story of my mother's life that she was very brave and
courageous and smart but she was never given the chance really to achieve.
My dad when I was seven he sat me down and he said you're very immature. It's
time for you to grow up now. Here's money. Why don't you go and live by

yourself? And by the way, you'll have to pay me back later, but you know, I hope
you have a good time. And I was sitting there very, very confused. I was actually
pretty good at math. I mean, this was a lot of money back then. Nevertheless, I
was excited about the money, but just a bit confused about being sent away to
live by myself. My mom came in, took the money away from me, and sent me to
bed. But that was typical of that. In many many ways, my father was not in touch
with reality. Dad believed the crazy things he did.
I am on the spectrum that my father was on. I think I'm really lucky that I
haven't had the sort of breakdowns that he had, but I'm way out there. I'm way
out there on the spectrum of believing things that most people don't believe.
And I believe them passionately, and I will argue to the death on them.
I was 8 years old when I was sent away to boarding school. It's a miserable
experience that I think only the British would do to each other's children.
Anyone you ever meet who says, "Oh, I love my school. It was all great." is lying.
We all cried our eyes out in these cold beds at night. I was the biggest person
there. I'm 6'3 and a half. And it was really like Lord of the Flies. Everyone would
challenge me to a fight every day.
Then, as you got a little bit used to it, I would just tell stories all the time because
all the kids were miserable and I was miserable and the good way to distract
them was to tell ridiculous stories. So, I would do that. But then you get caught
and if you got caught, you got beaten.
When you're sent away to school when you're very, very young, right? Then in
your life, you think love is your teddy bear and your dog and your brother and
sister and your bedroom and your home and all of that. And mom and dad say,
"We love you, so we're going to send you away to this school." And you're lying
in this cold bed and you're crying and you're thinking to yourself, "Well, am I
right that love is my teddy bear and all that stuff? Or are my parents right? That
love is to send you away to give you a chance in life." And obviously at age eight,
you think, well, my parents are right. And what that means is that you learn to
totally dissociate your emotions. And I do that and I should have a government
health warning on my forehead because when you're thinking about
dissociation, it's everything.
I didn't cry from the age of 10 onwards. I didn't cry at all. I didn't get angry. And
I don't think I had the slightest idea what love was until I had my own son. That's
weird. And that comes from what this does to a little child to be sent away to
boarding school.
One of the things about dad is he gave me a button when I was quite young
which said "question authority." And for me that really summed it all up. And
I'm actually really disappointed and sad about the people I was in school with

because I just think we were taught totally the wrong lessons about privilege.
We were taught that if you're born with a silver spoon in your mouth, you have
a duty and a right for it to metamorphose into gold instead of a duty to help
people who are less fortunate.
I went on to college and my brother was 2 and a half years ahead of me. When
I was about 10, I was reading a history book and it was about the Hundred Years
War, where the English were fighting the French and you know when you're a
testosterone youth in one of these schools and you're a boy, it's cool. But there
was a picture of Joan of Arc being burned at the stake and the picture in the
history book looked like my sister. I had a very good relationship with my sister
and I didn't think you know, okay, Joan of Arc was fighting the English but that
wasn't a reason to burn her at the stake and I found that pretty shocking.
So when I was a bit later on and we had the opportunity to do another history
thing I thought I'd do a history on the historical abolition of the death penalty.
It was abolished in England the year I was born. And there were lots of
notorious cases in England of innocent people being killed. And I just thought
it was ancient history. And then I start looking into it and the Americans, they're
still doing it to each other. And I was totally shocked. That was really my
motivation to start looking at America. And I thought, hey, I'm going to go to
America. I'm going to write this seminal book about the death penalty, the
Americans will see the error of their ways and that'll be the end of that.
Obviously totally ludicrous but that's what I wanted to do.
So I was going to go to a university in North Carolina and I was going to sort out
the death penalty. The project of scholarship that I was on actually had a series
of things you were meant to do in the summers and they were designed to make
you into a good capitalist American, and they sent me to work with the Los
Angeles Sheriff's Department. And I saw something that I'll never forget, which
was out one night with the cops. There were eight of them. And you know, I like
these people. We were having a nice chat. We were doing what we do best, which
was in a donut shop extorting donuts and coffee from the owner.
And there was a call that was some crazy guy. This was like 1981. We go out and
there's this guy who's clearly high as a kite on something and he's got a knife
and there are nine of us. There's me and eight of them. They've all got guns. I
don't have a gun, but we can take his knife off him. I mean, that's not very
difficult. And they put several bullets in the guy and just shot him in front of
me.
Those were the days long before cell phones. If I'd had a cell phone, that would
all be on camera and that would have been all around the world. You really think

how often were those things happening before we had cameras, but it happened
right in front of me and I was horrified.
So, I'd heard about this group in Atlanta and it was called Team Defense Project,
Inc. And it was headed by someone who had inherited some money and poured
it all into just defending people on death row. And it was a tiny office and there
were three lawyers. And so they were actually glad to have some totally useless
person like me to come and volunteer and they could then give me some job
which generally was just to visit people on death row.
You'd have a surprising number of people on death row who would get terribly
depressed and drop their appeals and try to get themselves executed. And that
was the lawyer's job then to try and stop that happening. And I would go in and
visit these people on death row and I didn't know what to talk to them about.
And it was just an extraordinary experience.
I rented a place in a small town in Georgia. I had no furniture or anything. I just
had a mattress on the floor. And then I would drive from there to the prison.
This was totally foreign. And people were incredibly nice. The people in the
prison would say "I love your accent. Where y'all from?" It was just a different
planet for me.
So, I'd had this intellectual opposition to the death penalty, but then you meet
people. These are just real human beings and they've got human frailties. Some
of them did it, some of them probably didn't. But why are we doing this?
You know what a lot of people talk about with the death penalty is about this
notion of evil. And I had always objected to that because people said my dad
was evil. I know my father and he's not evil. He's mad, he's not evil. And so I
had this whole real antipathy towards people using the word evil. And it was
quite early on in my days in the deep south as a kid, before I went to law school
that I was much more interested in understanding why people did something
bad than whether they did it, which is to understand people, not condemn them.
I had in college expected to be a fabulously famous author and it was only when
I realized that actually no one would read my book that I decided to go to law
school. So I just went and took the LSAT and I went to Columbia for one reason
and one reason only which is it was in New York City and I always wanted to
hang out there.
When you showed up at Columbia the first day, everyone was in suits and I
thought, "Oh my god, I've only got one suit, you know, I can't wear a suit every
day." Turns out they were all interviewing to go to a corporate law firm. And I
had no interest in that. I was only going to law school so I could go back to team

defense and do death penalty work, which I thought everyone would want to do,
but actually no one did. And that was rather sad.
So by now I was 24 and I took the bar exam and then went to Atlanta. I had no
money. I was staying in one room in Atlanta and I had a small amount to live
on for the year. But it didn't matter because I spent 90% of the time in the office.
And you know it's the beginning. You're suddenly thrown in the deep end and
I'm doing death penalty cases from day one. It should never have been allowed
and I did all my learning off the back of the people I was representing. But the
truth is they didn't have an option because they wouldn't get anyone else. But I
loved it and I would work 80 or 90 hours a week.
This was 1984 and by 1987 that was when I first lost someone. It was a young
African-American man on death row in Mississippi. At age 18, he'd been
convicted of killing a police officer and sexually assaulting an elderly white lady.
I took that on with just three weeks to go before he was due to get executed.
I thought we were going to win. I'd never lost a case. I was young and arrogant
and I thought I knew everything and I didn't know anything. And so in those
three weeks, I probably slept two hours a night and that was it. It was incredibly
hard. And then we started losing.
It was because I thought I knew best. And if I knew then what I know now, he
would be alive today and he'd be a granddad and he'd be a lovely guy and he was
the same age as me. And it was just something I hope people never experience.
It was set to happen around midnight as it always does in the middle of the night
and everyone's a bit ashamed of it. I was with the family and my client and the
warden was really nice and let us be together in the same room and we get the
final denial from the governor and I had to deliver that to my client.
Then we're in this little waiting room outside the gas chamber and there's all
this singing and people saying, you know, God will look after you and all that
stuff. And I don't believe that stuff. It's all mad. And we're going through this
total barbarism. The warden was trying to be nice and he was saying to my
client, you know, put a word in with the man upstairs for me. And he let me, it
was really decent of him. He let me go into the gas chamber with my client and
I went in and gave him a hug.
And my client still didn't believe and the phone rang and then he must have
thought, "Oh, thank God someone finally." But it wasn't that, it was the people
saying go ahead and kill him. And then they gassed him with Zyklon B, the same
stuff the Nazis used.
When you think about sitting there watching someone you like being murdered
in front of you, it's just so not of this world. It was horrible and it took forever.

And then I had to go break the news to the family afterwards. And then I had to
talk to the journalists and I don't blame them. It's their job. And I almost killed
myself driving home that night because I hadn't slept for days and I was really
upset.
I went to his funeral a few days later and this woman comes up to me and says,
"Well, I know he didn't do it because I was with him at the time." And I said,
"Why didn't you tell someone?" And she said, "Well, I did. I went to the police
and they told me to buzz off and mind my own business."
You see, if I'd gone there and I'd talked to all those people like I should have
instead of thinking that all this intellectual stuff is going to solve the case, I
would have found her and he would have gotten to stay. And it wasn't her fault
because when you think about it, the big lesson I learned from that is
Ghostbusters doesn't work in Mississippi. You know who you going to call?
There's no one you can call. You can't call the FBI. They were part of the
problem. You can't call anyone. It's ultimately up to those of us who are meant
to be representing these guys that we do what needs to be done.
Look, I don't sit here beating myself up because I suppress all that stuff like a
good public school boy. But I was wrong. And if I knew then what I know now,
he'd be alive.
I do think it's the ultimate honor. It's the right thing to do to take a hopeless
case every now and then, even when you know that you're not going to be able
to stop it, and do what you can.
A few years later in 1995, I was representing another client, a British guy who
was born in the same hospital I was, in Cambridge. He had had a miserable
childhood. He had a real drug addiction and he ended up being involved in
shooting someone in Georgia and trying to shoot a second person. It wasn't a
cold-blooded sociopathic thing. It was a young guy who did something terrible.
But I'd known him for 12 years, unlike my first client. I knew my first client for
3 weeks, but I knew this one for years. This was someone I knew who had been
with me through my divorce. And that is a heavy burden too when you lose
because you've had much more opportunity not to.
And the thing about this client was it was the electric chair and whatever they
say, the electric chair is just horrible. 2,400 volts of electricity put through you
to torture you to death in an unspeakable way. And he was very afraid of it as I
would be.
Even when it came to things like this ridiculous protocol that what would you
have for your last meal? Why would you eat just before you're going to be killed?
And he said that and he said, "I just want a cigarette." And the warden wouldn't

give him one. I said, "Warden, why not?" And he said, "We have rules. It's bad
for your health." I went out and told the media that, and they all laughed at him
so much that he finally caved and gave him a cigarette.
But then they tortured him to death. It was just horrible. And after that, I
dropped everything. It's the only time it really got through to me. And I left the
country and went back to England. Sat in the pub for two weeks. That was awful.
Awful. And if I close my eyes right now, I can see in black and white his bald
head and him being tortured to death in the electric chair.
The next one was another client. He was someone who everyone liked to hate
because he was on death row for three murders supposedly, but really didn't
happen like they think it happened. He was bipolar just like my dad and he was
much more depressed than he was manic. He was from Michigan and he was in
prison for three murders.
It was a thing where he posed as an FBI agent because he owed money from
gambling debts and he lost his biggest gambling debt when a basketball team
failed him and lost it again. They thought he went and shot these three people.
That's not what happened. But he was involved in it and he was going to spend
the rest of his life in prison and he didn't want to. So, he just wanted to die. And
so he kept dropping his appeals. And I took his case on because someone asked
me to.
And I got a lot of flack for doing that because here's a guy who wants to die and
I was stopping him dying. And this went on for 8 years. I put a lot of time in it.
Even my colleagues would say, "Why are you wasting your time? This guy wants
to die. We got lots of clients who don't want to die. Represent them."
I agonized over it, but I finally decided it was my job to stop him. And I'm not
sure, this is a difficult one. I'm not saying that I'm 100% right on that, but I just
think if you're not dying from a terminal illness that's fatal, then you're dying
because of some human thing that we just need to stop.
So, we went through eight years of this and we came within 40 minutes of his
execution four times. I got it stayed one time in the US Supreme Court with 58
seconds left on the clock. We won in the US Supreme Court and he was going to
have a chance and we could have got him off death row. No question about it.
But he got Christianity and suddenly here is a totally different person and he
really believed that he was going to a better place and he was totally calm about
it all. And we were old friends at that point. And I'm sitting there thinking, look,
you're not going to heaven. It doesn't exist. I'm sorry, but I'm not going to say
that because even though I believe it, it's just cruel to say something like that. I
wouldn't say that.

So anyway, this went on and I was driving down to be a witness at his execution.
Then I get down to the prison and he was just totally calm. We couldn't get a
stay and I'm there to witness and he's in the electric chair. And at the other times
when he'd been in that situation, he'd been utterly terrified. This time he's
totally calm and they ask him if he has any final words and he turns to them and
he says, "Lord, forgive them for they know not what they do."
And I looked around, but all these pseudo Christians witnessing his execution
looked at their feet. And he went to his death totally happy. And I've got to say,
bizarrely, that was one of the most humane, most wonderful experiences of my
life was having him die in front of me happy. It was really extraordinary.
The whole thing about a death penalty case is people try to depersonalize it and
pretend it's all just a game. And if you have more aggravating circumstances
than mitigating circumstances, then you give them the death penalty and that's
the right thing to do. No, it's not.
One case I brought a toy gun into the courtroom. And I said, you know, if this
prosecutor really thinks we should kill this guy, let's do it right here, right now.
Here's the gun. I want her to come up to my client, put the gun to his head, and
pull the trigger. And if she does that, it's only a toy. It won't kill him. But she's
got to do that to show she means it. And if she does it, I want you to watch her
and think, do I really want to be like her? And if she doesn't do it, then you know
she's trying to get you to do something she doesn't have the guts to do herself.
And that's the first question. The second question is WWJD. I want you to
imagine that there's a 13th person in the jury room and you turn to him and you
say, "Hey, Jesus, what would you do?" Honestly, honestly, how many of you
people think Jesus Christ, the person that you know from your Bible, would say,
"I think we should execute this person." I mean, it's just not going to happen.
This is deranged what they're asking you to do.
But the most important thing is from the Bible and it's very real. I'm not a
Christian, but I think the stuff in the Bible is really powerful as it is in the Quran
and in the Torah. "Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy" means
that if you don't show mercy, which is what this prosecutor wants you not to do,
you go to hell. If you do show mercy, you go to heaven. So, this is not really
about the person I'm representing. It's about you. And it's your choice what you
do.
I get in trouble over the years talking a lot about pedophiles. And you know, the
one group that people hate, hate, hate are pedophiles. And no one wants to be
a pedophile. No one chooses to be a pedophile. It's obviously a mental illness of
sorts. And the person who was most obviously that was a client I represented in
Louisiana.

So this client's story was that before he was born, his mom and dad are driving
down the road and dad is drunk and mom is in the seat next to him and the two
kids are in the back seat, no seat belts, 1965. And dad drives off the road into a
telegraph pole. He's fine as he's drunk. The two kids are instantly killed. The
wife is thrown through the front of the car and is in charity hospital and she's in
a body cast from her neck to her ankle.
So then what happens is the wife gets pregnant when she's in the body cast
because her husband is abusive and no one believes she's pregnant. She's in a
body cast. My client is that fetus and he's exposed for five months to his own
personal Hiroshima of X-rays and one of the drugs that the mother was taking
is now linked to being a pedophile later in life if you were exposed in utero.
And so my client is born, he's very very mentally traumatized but he's very
intelligent. When he was a child, he's sexually abused himself. At age 10, he puts
a sign on the notice board saying, "I'm not [my name]. I'm [my dead brother's
name]." He becomes fixated that his dead brother is his alter ego who's making
him molest children.
And then he ends up going to prison in Georgia when he's about 21. And they
give him therapy and they teach him he's a pedophile. And they teach him why.
And they say, "You're incurable. So you're always going to be a pedophile. You
will always molest children." My client writes a letter to the Georgia Pardons
Board saying, "You know, you've convinced me. I want you to put me in a mental
hospital forever." And of course, they don't do that. They let him go.
And he goes back to Louisiana where a mother and her son who was 6 years old
- the child bizarrely looked just like the dead brother. I had picture of the dead
brother and a picture of the victim and their own aunt couldn't tell them apart.
And my client ends up strangling the child, thinking that he's strangling his
dead brother. Now, he's all crazy, of course.
Finally, the child's missing. They can't find him, there's a big search. They finally
find him and my client then gives a confession to try and get himself killed
where he says he molested 250 children. He wants to die. And I say, "Look, my
client is really, really mentally disturbed, but he's intelligent and he knows what
he did now, and he wants to say sorry."
So the mother goes down to the parish jail in western Louisiana, spends 3 hours
with my client where he one-on-one in a jail cell, tells her what happened and
why, and he's really sorry, and reassures her that he didn't molest the child, he
just killed the child. And this was a big deal to the mother.
Now, the prosecutor obviously desperately wanted to say that my client had
sexually molested the child because that helps him get the death penalty. That's

not what the mother wants to hear and it's not true. But anyway, at the end of
these 3 hours, the mother says to my client, "I'm going to fight for you." And she
goes down to the DA's office and talks to the DA and says, "I don't want this
death penalty stuff. You can't do this." And the DA says to her, "You're a very
strange victim." And then tries to take away her other child, saying she's an unfit
mother.
So we go to trial and the mother wants to testify at the penalty phase that she
doesn't want the death penalty and the prosecution fights tooth and nail to stop
her doing that. And the mother, you have to understand, is an uneducated
alcoholic from southwest Louisiana, very, very Christian. And she goes away
and she prays and she comes back the next day and she says, "You know, the
logic of my position is he shouldn't go to prison. He should go to a mental
hospital. And if you can assure me he'll never get out, I want to testify that he
should go to a mental hospital." And then she testifies.
So, I said, "Do you have an opinion as to whether that man over there who killed
your six-year-old child who was mentally ill at the time he did it?" She turns to
the jury and she said, "Yeah, as a matter of fact, I do. I think that my client has
been crying out for help since the day he was born. And for whatever reason, his
family, society, and now the legal system has never listened to him. As I sit on
this witness chair, I can hear the death cries of my son crying out for help. He
was mentally ill when he killed my child."
It was just the most amazing thing and she is the most amazing woman and she
needs her story to be told because the thing we need to do for victims is not tell
them they should hate hate hate. The only people who are hurt by that are them.
I want to make sure it doesn't happen again to someone else, but I also want to
make sure that we try lowering the temperature. And this is what she's doing.
And she's trying to understand. And I so admire that woman.
I've been a victim. I've been held up, put in hospital on an attempted murder
one time. I found over the years that all the terrible things I've experienced, your
pain can be a real possibility. And so when I was held up at gunpoint and put in
hospital in New Orleans, that made me a much better defense lawyer because I
suddenly had experienced something really serious and unpleasant.
And it made me think about two things. One is whether I could ID people really
and how sure I'd have to be. And if I, as a liberal white person, said those three
black guys did it, they're going to get life in prison. And am I going to do that?
No, I'm not going to do that. So that was a terrible experience. I had my jaw
wired shut with a broken jaw for weeks. Some people thought that was great. I
couldn't talk so much. But it does make you a much better lawyer.

So this was a case in Louisiana and I was representing a guy who had killed his
soon to be ex-wife and her boyfriend who happened to be the nephew of the
congressperson and so it was a bit of a big deal. And my client was this guy who
was really pretty slow. I like him but I was trying to work out how to present
him to a jury.
So I was sitting with him and I was doing what I do to a lot of people. I was
saying, "What's your dream in life?" And he said to me, "My dream is to have a
job with health insurance, to have a house with a mortgage, to have a wife and
children." I said, "No, no, no, no, no. I'm not asking you about what basic
standard of living is. I'm asking you what your dream is. What's your dream
dream?" And he just repeated the same thing. And I was thinking, "Oh my god."
And then I realized, of course, that I'm the weird one, not him. For most people,
that really is their dream.
And so I picked a jury. I love picking juries. And I asked them all, "What's your
dream in life?" And I picked 12 people who said exactly what my client said.
The story of this case was that he was married to this woman who was smarter
than him and he had the two kids and he had the house with a mortgage and he
had a job with health insurance and then his wife, she went off with this
congressman's nephew and so she took the kids. She took the house. He had a
breakdown over this and so he lost his job and he basically lost his mind as well
as everything else.
And then he happens to be round at his own house and he sees his wife with this
guy and loses it. And because it's America, he's got a gun and he ends up
shooting both of them.
So the whole of my theory of the case was not that he didn't do it. He did do it.
But it was that this was the straw that broke the camel's back was seeing the two
of them. And we went through loading onto the camel the loss of the kids, the
loss of the house, the loss of the wife, the loss of the job, the loss of the insurance.
And then he sees this and I'm doing the closing argument and I'm telling this
story and the guy in the front row looks like he wants to execute me too. And
I'm terrified that I'm not getting through to these people.
So at any rate, we finish, they go out to deliberate. They're out for less than 10
minutes and they come back in our favor and they say they don't want to talk to
the prosecutors. They want to talk to me. So I go in there and I talk to this juror
and I say, "Man, I thought you were going to kill me, too." And he said, "I was
just trying not to cry. You were talking about me."
It was just amazing. But the most amazing thing was the night before that
closing argument, one of the prosecutors comes up to me and says, "Will you go

for a drink?" So, we go to some bar and he says, "You know, I've handed in my
notice. I've told them I'm not doing this case anymore because you've convinced
me it's just wrong and we just shouldn't be doing this." And oh god, I was so
touched, because it was so lovely to have someone who had been fighting for
weeks and months to kill my client to decide that actually my client shouldn't
have that.
That was the case that taught me really really that I needed to speak the
language of the jurors instead of my language. The language of Christianity as a
Christian, I need to speak the language of what they believe, not what I believe.
And I think the vast majority of civil liberties lawyers in America run away from
religion and they run away from that and they want to give lectures to jurors
about how the death penalty is just wrong, wrong, wrong. And while I believe
that, that's not what these jurors believe. You can't say that. You got to talk to
every juror the way they hear it.
When 9/11 happened, I was preparing a capital case in Louisiana. And I was
looking to go talk to a pathologist that morning. And I was driving around and
it was just like a ghost town. I couldn't find anyone. It was really weird. So I
went back to the place we were staying and the planes were flying into the
building and you know to begin with you thought it was just a little plane and
whatever.
I've got to say I just totally misjudged America because I didn't remember that
you can name the three times the territorial integrity of America's been
breached. I mean it was September 11th in 2001. It was Pearl Harbor. That's
December 7th, 1941. And then it was 1812 when the British burned the White
House. That's it.
So when they start talking about Guantanamo Bay, I thought this would be a
problem. So I start calling around my friends and saying, "We got to stop this
because everyone who is going to Guantanamo Bay, people forget this, they
were all going to face the death penalty." And this is the new group of people
that we're being told we have to hate, instead of young black men, it's now
Muslim people.
So I call around all my friends. No one wanted to do it. And I couldn't believe it.
And I finally got two colleagues who agreed to work on it. So we sued regarding
Guantanamo on February 19th, 2002 and we alleged because we started hearing
rumors that everyone was being tortured and that our clients were not guilty
and the media was interested in it.
So I went on television to defend what we were doing. I did a five-minute
interview in which I was accused of being a traitor to America 13 times. I got
amazing death threats that night. It was extraordinary. And then we sued and

we lost in the district court. We lost in the court of appeal. And we get to the US
Supreme Court. That's when Abu Ghraib happened. Everyone thought that they
could trust the president and the administration and I didn't.
It took 2 and 1/2 years to get in. And we got in in 2004 and I start meeting
people and they're not terrorists. I was having a terrible time finding an honest
to goodness terrorist.

The first person I met was a British guy and he's like 5 foot 2, incredibly well-
spoken and I wrote up 30 pages of how he'd been tortured and how he'd

watched someone be murdered at Bagram airport and how he was suffering
from PTSD. And I submit 33 pages I think of my notes and they censor every
word.
And I go talk to the CIA guy and I say, "What do you mean? Why can't I tell
people how he's been tortured?" This guy says, "Well, that is the methods and
means of interrogation that's classified." I say, "Well, you can't tell me that
murdering someone, the taxi driver, was a method of interrogation." And the
guy sort of smirks and says, "Yeah, you can." I say, "Well, what about this stuff
about his mental illness?" Said they're censoring that because it's his privacy.
Well, he doesn't want it censored.
So they wouldn't let it out. So I wrote a letter to the British prime minister. I
said, "Dear Prime Minister, torture and abuse of British national by the
Americans." And the British went crazy because it's all very well if you trample
on Muslims, but you can't trample on our Muslims.
This is what's gone on for the last 23 years in Guantanamo. They're crazy. And
of the 780 prisoners though, we've got 765 out. They said these are the worst
terrorists in the world, we've proved they're not in 98.5% of the cases. And this
is why the rule of law is important because when they pick a group of people to
hate, they want you to just hate them blindly.
When I was flying on British Airways to Guantanamo a couple of years ago, I
talked to the nice stewardess. I said, you know, let's pretend you're on an airline
and your flight landed at the wrong airport 98% of the time or maybe crashed
98% of the time. Would you fly that airline? Oh, no. But this is what
Guantanamo Bay is. And no one knows it. And we need to be there to protect
not just the people, but the whole principle.
I've learned so much over the last 20-some years in Guantanamo because
honestly when I thought of intelligence agencies, I thought they're intelligent.
They so aren't. And I'm talking about the British and the Americans. The
intelligence agency came to the pub in my village and was trying to recruit me
as an informant. And I said, "Look, I'm not going to do that, but I'm happy to

come to your office and just talk to you. I don't even have to have you say
anything to me. I just want to tell you how wrong you are on all this stuff because
you've never met these human beings. And if you do, you'll learn two things.
One is you're wrong about most of them. But the second is one of my clients, for
example, doesn't believe in violence. He's a Muslim. He's the best person to help
you achieve some peace."
And my favorite favorite favorite was I loved my client who was 14 years old. He
was a black kid in Saudi Arabia. Then the question you have to ask yourself is,
how do you prove you're 14 years old, not 26 years old when you're in
Guantanamo by yourself? It's quite difficult. But I asked that question of the
CIA guy. I said, how would you do it? And he starts hemming and hawing and
talking about testing your teeth and all that stuff. I said, "Why don't we just get
his birth certificate?"
And so we sent off and got his birth certificate. It took 30 minutes. By then, he
had spent 3 years in Guantanamo. So then some snitch in Guantanamo says
that he was in the London cell of al-Qaeda. And they say that because I'm his
lawyer and I've got a British accent. Then we had to prove that when the guy
said he was leader of al-Qaeda in London, he was 9 years old and had never
been out of Saudi Arabia. I mean, it's just crazy stuff. And you can't help but
love that these are the people making decisions.
They tortured someone till he said that Saddam Hussein had WMD and that's
why we went to war in Iraq in a big way and lots of people got killed and it was
all false.
I love going to Guantanamo. I've been there 42 times. It's a nightmare of a place
at one level, but it's when I get to go see the clients and to me what this is all
about are the human beings.
My whole theory, which is Guantanamo is all a lie and they've got it all secret
because they want to pretend that they're doing something about 9/11. And if
we open it up to public inspection, they will close it down because it'll be too
embarrassing. And that's been our principle all along. So I've represented 87
people. The courts ordered the release of one. The other 86 got out because we
went in there, we got the truth out, we published it to the world, we embarrassed
the US military so much that they said, "Let's send this guy home." So, we won.
And that's an amazing thing.
When I got to be about 60, I thought, look, it's really about time I teach some
other people. So I set up a new nonprofit where I want to make all these young
people superheroes. So the first principle is you got to figure out what your
passion really is and it's not "I want to do nice good things." That's too vague.

You got to get something quite particular and it's why stories about your parents
and people who chose you are very important because they inform who you are.
For me, just to give you the example, through my mother and my father, my
fundamental passion is to look around the world for the most hated people in
the world and get between them and the people doing the hatred. And the
reason for that is because you always know you're right. People are going
around hating, whether they're hating people on death row, they're hating
Muslims in Guantanamo, they're hating Palestinians, they're hating whomever,
they're hating Jews. It's all wrong. The more hated the people you help, the
easier it is because the more hated, the more wrong it is.
So then once you worked out what your passion is, and I have a process to try
and help people do that, you then got to think, how do you move that forward?
And you must never put your life in the hands of someone else. So this idea that
you as a young person are going to go up to someone and say, "Hey, I'd really
like to do cool things. I'd like you to pay me for it," it's just not going to happen.
You don't need to do that. And what I did was I learned at a very young age, you
got to figure out how you create your own job. It's not hard. And so that means
that you just have to raise money to do it. You might never get rich. That doesn't
matter.
The average person is going to work 100,000 hours in her or his life. And if
you're going to do that, it's got to be something you love. Otherwise, you're going
to be really bored. So, you got to figure out what your passion is and what you're
going to do, and then you've got to create your own job.
My charity is about helping young people figure out what they'd love to do and
then helping them do it. So, I've had students working with me and I think my
primary job is to let them see how much fun this stuff is, how fulfilling it is, how
you can take someone's life and give it back to them. It's just amazing.
If I had to say what I find most surprising, it's that it's so obvious to me that you
want to do something you actually absolutely love and that to do that you've got
to make it happen for yourself. And this is the ultimate rule and it's the ultimate
rule for me. It should be the ultimate rule for everyone which is we all have the
same utopia. We all have the same ideal.
So every decision you ever make has got to go one way or the other. It either
takes you closer to your ideal or further away. Now in my life, it's really simple
because I just always do what takes me closer. What's mad about these
politicians and a lot of other people is they want to do things that takes them in
the other direction. That's just total insanity.

One of the principles that I think is obvious in life is that we should always try
to be decent to other people. We should try to understand them. We should try
to be kind. It really is about do to others as you would have done to you. The
antithesis of that is hatred. And I just never see the point. Hatred is just always
wrong. So for me, taking on hatred has got to be right. It's just that simple.
