You've got to always think down a couple of layers and say, they're saying that, but it's not that. Right? There's something else going on. And I have to understand them and understand their needs. Remember Rip heard the needs that no one else heard? Beth, love of my life. Right? He heard her needs. She didn't express her needs. She didn't say, I need to feel wanted and loved and important. She didn't say that. But from all of the stuff that was going on, he knew that's what she needed. He could read the room, read the person and understood the context of that conversation and move to needs. He moved from logic to emotion. What you're asking for, for what you need. Right? I want you to remember how important needs are."
