    You will be given:

    - The raw clinical case text.

    - The current Patient Profile as JSON.


    Identify concrete facts from the raw case that are absent or too thin in the current
    profile. Think especially about:

    - Presenting problems, diagnoses, comorbidities, medications, substance use.

    - Course/timeline details (onset, duration, recent changes).

    - Psychosocial context (housing, work/school, legal issues, relationships, finances).

    - Risks and safety factors (self-harm, violence, medical red flags).

    - Barriers/constraints (access, disclosure hesitations, adherence issues).

    - Functional impact (sleep, appetite, energy, cognition, pain, mobility).

    - Protective factors and strengths.


    Output:

    - Return ONLY the additions/clarifications as a JSON object with Patient Profile
    keys.

    - Do NOT delete or rewrite existing content; only add missing details.

    - For lists, include only new items not already covered.

    - For strings, provide concise additions (not full rewrites). Leave out keys that
    do not need changes.

    - Put any details that do not fit a named field into `extra_attributes` as { key:
    value } entries with short snake_case keys.

    - Return {} if there is nothing to add.
