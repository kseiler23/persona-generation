  "raw_transcript": "Interviewer: Can you tell me what brought you in? Respondent: I've been having this dull ache in my chest for about a week. It sits near the left side and sometimes goes up toward my neck. The first time was when I was gardening for a while. It comes on when I'm moving around and settles when I stop. Interviewer: How often has it happened? Respondent: Three times this week—gardening, walking my dog, and once it even woke me up. The longest was maybe half an hour and I got worried. Interviewer: Do you get sweaty or sick with it? Respondent: No, I don't get sweaty or throw up. Just short of breath while it hurts. Interviewer: Any medical problems? Respondent: I was told I had high blood pressure a few years ago but stopped the pills because they made me sleepy. I had an ulcer way back in the 90s but it got better. Interviewer: Do you drink or smoke? Respondent: I don't smoke. I have a beer or two on weekends and a glass of wine with dinner once a week. Interviewer: Any heart issues in the family? Respondent: My dad died of a heart attack at 54. Mom is alive and well. No brothers or sisters. Interviewer: Medicines or allergies? Respondent: I'm not on anything now—just take ibuprofen sometimes for headaches. I'm allergic to penicillin; it gave me a rash years ago.",
